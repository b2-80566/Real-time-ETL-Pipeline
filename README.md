# Real-time-ETL-Pipeline
We utilize web scraping to extract live stock data, transmitting it to Kafka for seamless processing via Apache Spark. Processed data is stored in HDFS, while Apache Airflow automates the workflow for continuous real-time data analysis. Our goal is to equip analysts and traders with a comprehensive dataset for informed decision-making.
